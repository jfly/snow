# TODO: figure this out!
# # Some hackiness to get Kodi's Chorus2's web ui working with websockets.
# # The UI is hardcoded to use port 9090 for websockets:
# #  https://github.com/xbmc/chorus2/blob/f9f376930fd544e86b1dd3c0dc5f8999031d73c5/src/js/app.coffee#L8
# # Here we terminate the incoming ssl (wss://) connection, and forward the connection unencrypted to the real kodi box.
# # Note that we've also configured our router to forward external connections to
# # port 9090 to clark:9090 (http://strider.snowdon.jflei.com/Advanced_VirtualServer_Content.asp).
# # I really don't think it should be this difficult. I don't understand why a separate port is even necessary.
# # Hopefully a better solution shows up on https://github.com/xbmc/chorus2/issues/133 someday.
