# Note: I've manually edited this .ovpn file to ignore the pushed DNS server.
# However, it should be possible to instead configure things so we only use
# that DNS server for some domains. See
# https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn3-linux/issues/208 for a question I filed
# about this.
# If we don't get an answer there, we could implement this with a custom script.
# See script documentation here: https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn3-linux/blob/master/docs/man/openvpn2.1.rst#script-execution
# The command to run will be something like: `sudo resolvectl domain tun0 '~honorcare.com'`.
