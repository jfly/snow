# It's very annoying, but moonlight-qt and moonlight-embeded have completely
# different command line apis. Here's an example of how to do this with
# moonlight-embedded:
# moonlight stream $gurgi -app Desktop -width 1920 -height 1200

# This aspect ratio matches my laptop
# Note: it's not enough to just use this resolution, you also need to update
# the host resolution, either by hand, or with a tool like
# https://github.com/Nonary/ResolutionAutomation/.
# aspect_ratio=1920x1200

# This is the aspect ratio we keep Gurgi at.
aspect_ratio=1920x1080

# `--absolute-mouse` makes it easier to get my mouse *out* of the stream. Not
# sure what the downsides of it are.
# `--capture-system-keys fullscreen` and `--display-mode windowed` work
# together in a quite useful way: by default, xmonad on my laptop still gets
# control of the mod key (Windows key). However, if I'm really going to be
# spending some time in the stream, I can enable fullscreen mode
# (ctrl+alt+shift+x), and now the stream gets all my keys.
moonlight stream $gurgi Desktop \
